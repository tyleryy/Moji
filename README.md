# Moji

In a world where education has become increasingly remote and reliant on online platforms, we need human connection more than ever. Many students often find it difficult to express their feelings without unmuting themselves and drawing unwanted attention. As a result, teachers are unaware of how their students are feeling and if the material is engaging. This situation is especially challenging for students who struggle with communicating their feelings–such as individuals with autism, selective mutism, social anxiety, and more.

We created **Moji** to bridge this gap by creating a tool that will both enable students to express themselves with less effort and enable teachers to understand and respond to their overall needs.

We strongly believe in the importance of accessibility in education and supplementing human connection, because at the end of the day, humans are all social beings.
